    <p class="about-para">I am a full stack web developer based in Milwaukee, WI. As a teenager, I loved toying around with Geocities but when it became too limiting, I taught myself HTML and a bit of CSS (my apologies, I wrote all my styles inline back then!) and spent my high school days making websites for my friend's bands using an absurd amount of frames, tables, and flash. Though I have moved on from Notepad to VS Code, I still have the same passion for learning new technologies that drove a 14 year old to figure out how on earth an FTP program worked. The stack I am currently experienced with contains the following technologies, but I am always eager to add more!</p>
