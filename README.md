# My Portfolio
This is a simple portfolio for the sake of showing off my coding projects.  Over time, my intention is to continue adding new features and a new design.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wrote this using just HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.  The original draft of the site is almost entirely CSS and HTML, except for a single script to close the hamburger menu.  

## Lessons Learned:

I built this site using a Figma template, but wrote all of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript myself.  It was my first time creating a full mobile first website from a template, and I learned a lot about the power of Flexbox in making a responsive website scale well between devices.  I also learned a lot making the hamburger menu.
